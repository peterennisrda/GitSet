### Creating New Repository ###

You can create a new repository on your personal account or any organization where you have sufficient permissions. In the upper left corner, you should see your personal account name and thumbnail. If your organization is showing instead, and you are not a manager in the organization, you will not be able to create Repository. Click your Member name to switch to your personal account "context".

As a security measure, it is a good practice to ensure Pull Requests (PRs) must be made on a separate branch and require at least one review from a team member to be merged in the master branch.

1. Click **Settings** in the repository
2. Click **Branches** in the left columen
3. By **Branch protection rules** click the **Add rule**
4. Under **Branch protection rule** tick the box for **Require pull request reviews before merging**

### Forking A Repository ###

For overview of Forking Repo ([https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo])

Forking a Repository (Repo) creates a copy of the Repo, so you can experiment with it and not effect the original.

Go to a Repo, and find the **Fork** button in the upper right corner. A copy of the repo will then be available to work with in your account.
